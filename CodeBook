This CodeBook file aims at describing the data set created in this Project.
Since it is a new data set, the codebook appended to the raw data set may not be sufficient
to provide all the relevant information.

"GroupedData.txt" was created from the original dataset and transformed by following 5 main steps:

1) Merge "X_train.txt" & "x_test.txt"; "y_train.txt" & "y_test.txt" to create one dataset.

2) From the set of measurements that were estimated, only those on mean and standard deviation were selected
to create the new dataset. Therefore, the number of variables was slashed from 561 to 68.

3) The values of the column "Activity", originally derived from the non-specific "Id" variable,
were replaced by their respective labels.

4) The variable names were updated in order to improve readability.

5) The 68-variable dataset was grouped by "Subject" and "Activity" and the mean function was applied to each group
and variable. Therefore, the outcome is a dataset containing average values of each variable for each group.

The script for such procedure is in "run_analysis.R" listed in this repo.
