# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

 The goal of this Project is to prepare and summarize tidy data for later analysis.
 This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
 
 The raw data set is provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository and refers to an experiment on Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions. The data may be found here:

 Along with this README.md file, this repository contains the following files:

- CodeBook.md, which adresses the variables, the data, and transformations that were performed to clean up the data;
- run_analysis.R, a script for performing the analysis in RStudio. 
- GroupedData.txt, which is the new data set created to meet the requirements of the project.
